   - Download the video in optimal quality
   - Reply to the original message with the downloaded video

## How it Works

1. The bot monitors all messages in groups where it's added
2. When a YouTube link is detected, it extracts the URL
3. The ClipProcessor class handles downloading the video:
   - Selects optimal format (480p MP4)
   - Downloads the video content
   - If needed, downloads audio separately and merges it with FFmpeg
   - Sends the final video back to the Telegram group
